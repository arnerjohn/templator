Templator
=========

## Goal

Generate a basic web app boiler plate with your favorite Javascript framework.

## Install

The easiest way to use Templator is to pull it to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/arnerjohn/templator.git

cd templator
```

then, generate the `escript` with the following:

```
mix escript.build
```

This will generate a `templator` binary that you can place in your path. For example:

```
mv templator ~/bin/templator
```

## Usage

Templator currently supports React.js. Executing the following command will generate a new `Mix` project by the name of `ReactExample`. 

```
templator new react_example --react

cd react_example
mix

Listening for connections...
```

The template comes pre-configured with Cowboy to run on `port 4000`. After you `cd` to the newly created directory, you can run the program with the `mix` command and visit `localhost:4000`. You will see a `Hello World` generated by React.js.

It is that easy...or, at least, it is intended to be
